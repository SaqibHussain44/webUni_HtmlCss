		<img src="../graphics/places/sukkurbarrage.jpg" alt="image" class="floatright-lg">
		<p><b>Sukkur Barrage</b> (Urdu سكهر بئراج) is a barrage on the River Indus near the city of Sukkur in the Sindh province of Pakistan. The Barrage was built during the British Raj from 1923 to 1932 and was named Lloyd Barrage. The Sukkur Barrage, is the pride of Pakistan’s Irrigation system as it is the largest single Irrigation network of its kind in the world. It irrigates from Sukkur District in the North, to Mirpurkhas/ Tharparkar and Hyderabad districts in the South of Sindh, almost all parts of the Province except few. It is situated about 300 miles North East of Karachi, 3 miles below the Railway Bridge, or the Sukkur Gorge. The introduction of barrage-controlled irrigation system resulted in more timely water supplies for the existing cultivated areas of Sindh Province of Pakistan.</p>

		<img src="../graphics/places/lansdowne-bridge.jpg" alt="image" class="floatright-lg">
		<p><b>The Lansdowne Bridge Rohri</b> at Sukkur (Sindhi لينسڊائون پل روهڙي) (Urdu: لینس ڈاؤن پل روہڑی ‎) is a bridge over the Indus River between Sukkur city and Rohri town of Sindh, Pakistan. Any visitor to Sukkur-Rohri Pakistan is usually awe struck by the largest man made monuments in the area. They are two in number. One is the over one century old Lansdowne Bridge and the other is the Ayub Bridge.<br>
		A marvel of 19th-century engineering, the 'longest 'rigid' girder bridge in the world' at that time, it was begun in 1887. It was designed by Sir Alexander Meadows Rendel; he designed the Lansdowne Bridge Rohri at Sukkur over the Indus River, which when it was completed in 1889 was the largest cantilever bridge in the world. The girder work, weighing a massive 3,300 tons, was manufactured in London by the firm of Westwood, Baillie and erected by F.E. Robertson, and Hecquet.</p>

		<img src="../graphics/places/masum-shah.jpg" alt="image" class="floatright-lg">

Masum Shah was the governor of Mughal Emperor Akbar who appointed him as the Nawab of Sukkur. The minaret was built in about 1607 the monument, built of red brick, is more or less conical in shape, slightly off the perpendicular and surmounted by a dome to which an internal stone staircase gives an access. It is about 26 metres in circumference and has 84 steps to the top. It is about 31 metres feet in height and can be seen from miles away. This minaret is believed to have been used as a watch tower.In around 1595 he led Akbar's army in a battle against the Baluch stronghold of Sibi in northwest Quetta, resulting in Baluchistan being annexed into the Mughal empire</p>

		<h2>Sadhu Belo Sukkur</h2>
		<img src="../graphics/places/sadh-belo.jpg" alt="image" class="floatright-lg">
		<p>Sadh Belo is an island downstream of Bukkur island and separated from it by a short stretch of river. The island with its two inlets, Sadh Belo and Din Belo, is shown on the official map of 1893-4; in 1912 it was accurately surveyed on the orders of the Collector.Sindhi are settled in Sadh Belo and the surrounding countryside. The majority of the population is Muslim with a significant Hindu minority.There is a Hindu temple on the island, founded in 1823 by Swami Bakhandi Maharaj Udasi; the gaily-painted buildings are, however, more or less modern. The place is held in high esteem by Hindus throughout Sindh and even in India, occasionally attracting pilgrims from across the border.

		<h2>Tomb of seven sisters</h2>
		<img src="../graphics/places/seven-sisters.jpg" alt="image" class="floatright-lg">
		<p><b>Rohri, also known as Sateen Jo Aastan</b> is the resting place for the Seven Female-friends. According to folklore these female friends resided here. These unmarried female-friends veiled themselves from all males, a practice called purdah (the practice of preventing men from seeing women), which is also referred to as sattei. But for the fear of a tyrannical raja resulted in their disappearance, possibly in a cave in the side of a hill. Thus they became satti. It is probable that this folklore has its origins in the Hindu ritual of sati, an inhumane ritual where widows burnt themselves or were burnt on their dead husband's pyre.
		In reality however, this is the burial place of a ruler from Sukkur, Mir Abu Al-Qasim Namkeen (961 A.H, ). The tomb complex was ordered to be built by him. It was constructed in the ochre stone similar to that used in the necroplis of Makli Hill. Inscriptions and Quranic verses in the finest Naskh script adorn the walls and interior of these structures. Rows of hujras (rooms on the ground floor) were constructed for travellers and students. The famous blue tiles of Sindh were used to enhance the aesthetic impact.</p>

It was built at a cost of 120 million rupees, and is still under development. There is a separate family area with a small hotel. There is also a boat riding facility. The garden has many beautiful plants. It is a main visiting place in Sukkur city.
		Lab-e-Mehran is well-known plot in Sukkur, positioned on Bandar Street, neighboring to the Indus stream, in Sindh Province, Pakistan. It was constructed with a very high price and it is at rest underneath progress. There is a separate part for people district with a minute lodge. There is also yacht and boating facility available. The backyard is complete of attractive plant life. This is chief tourist destination in Sukkur urban town. Occasionally plenty of waste in addition can be seen at diverse spaces. Just like any other tourist place this is one is also another place which has been neglected. The lawn had lush greenery all around and along the river Indus, which is nowhere to be seen. In fact this is only place where locals can come and spend time together because they don’t have a different set to go and it’s an enjoyable and tranquil place it’s along the Indus.</p>

		<h2>Muhammad Bin Qasim Park</h2>
		<img src="../graphics/places/bin-qasim.jpg" alt="image" class="floatright-lg">
		<p><b>‘Imād ad-Dīn Muḥammad ibn Qāsim ath-Thaqafī </b>(Arabic: عماد الدين محمد بن القاسم الثقفي‎‎; c. 31 December 695 – 18 July 715[citation needed]) was an Umayyad general who conquered the Sindh and Multan regions along the Indus River (now a part of Pakistan) for the Umayyad Caliphate. He was born and raised in the city of Ta'if (in modern-day Saudi Arabia). Qasim's conquest of Sindh and southern-most parts of Multan enabled further Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent.<br>
		A member of the Thaqif tribe of the Ta'if region, Muhammad bin Qasim's father was Qasim bin Yusuf[citation needed] who died when Muhammad bin Qasim was young, leaving his mother in charge of his education and care. Umayyad governor Al-Hajjaj Ibn Yusuf Al-Thaqafi, Muhammad bin Qasim's paternal uncle, was instrumental in teaching Muhammad bin Qasim about warfare and governance. Muhammad bin Qasim married his cousin Zubaidah, Al-Hajjaj's daughter, shortly before going to Sindh.<br>
		Due to his close relationship with Al-Hajjaj, Bin Qasim was executed after the accession of Caliph Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik.</p>
