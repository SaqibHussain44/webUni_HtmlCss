	<img src="../../graphics/personalities/sir-ghulamhussain-lg.jpg" alt="personalityimage" class="personalityimage">
	<p><b>Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah</b> KCSI (Sindhi: غلام حسين هدايت الله‎), was a popular Pakistani politician from the province of Sindh. He held various offices in the province of Sindh involving 1st Chief M.(1937–1938) and being re-appointed as fifth Chief M.(1942–1947).</p>
	<h1>BioGraphy</h1>
	<p>Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah was born in the year of 1879 at Shikarpur and acquired his education from the Institute of Shikarpur High School, Sindh Madressah, Karachi, D. J. Sindh College, Karachi and Government Law College, Bombay.<br>
	After gaining his education of LL.B. in the year 1902, he began his legal practice in the city of Hyderabad Sindh. He initiated his public career as Vice President of the Hyderabad Municipality. Hidayatullah was also the 1st Non-official President of the Hyderabad District Board. In the year of 1921 he became a Member of the Bombay Legislative Council. In the similar year, he was elected as a Minister in the Bombay Government, an office which he occupied till the year of 1928 when he was made a Member of the Executive council of the Governor of Bombay. He served in this capacity till the year of 1934. He acquired the title of Khan Bahadur from the British government, which also knighted him in the 1926 year New Year Honors and further elected him a Knight Commander of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India (KCSI) in the year of 1933 Birthday Honors.<br>
	As a Minister, Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah was linked with the popular ‘Sukkur Barrage project‘ which contributed so much to the development of Sindh in later years. Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah, along with Syed Miran Shah, Khan Bahadur Muhammad Ayub Khuhro, and Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto, represented the province of Sindh in the Round Table Conferences in the city of London. They convinced the Chairman of the ‘Committee on Sindh’ that Sindh province wasn’t to be a deficit province and had enough revenue and administrative capability to be a fully fledged province. Sindh was then separated from Bombay and its 1st assembly came into being in the year of 1937.<br>
	After the separation of Sindh from the Bombay, Sir Ghulam Hussain became the 1st Chief Minister and remained so until the year of 1947 with 2 short breaks when Allah Bux Soomro and Mir Bande Ali Talpur had made their Governments. Sir Ghulam Hussain became the Chief Minister of Sindh 3 times.<br>
	In the year of 1938, the Sindh Assembly approved a resolution claiming a separate homeland for the Muslims of India. In the year of 1943, the Sindh Government became the 1st Provincial Assembly of the sub-continent to pass an official resolution in favor of the creation of Pakistan. When the Muslim League in the year of 1946 decided on a policy of renunciation of titles conferred by the British Government, Sir Ghulam renounced his British titles and honorifics.
	<br>
	After the creation of Pakistan, Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah gained the unique distinction of being the mere Pakistani Governor of a Province in Pakistan as all other Governors were British. This indicates the faith and trust the Quaid-e-Azam laid in him.<br>
	Within a month of Quaid-e-Azam’s death, Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah the “Grand Old Man of Sindh” breathed last in the city of Karachi on the day of October 4, 1948.</p>
	<h1>Career of Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah</h1>

The second term was on the day of March 7, 1941 to October 14, 1947, and served the longest time period that any chief minister has so far held. After the creation of Pakistan, he became the 1st Governor of Sindh from the time period of August 14, 1947 to Oct 4, 1948. He died in office.</p>
