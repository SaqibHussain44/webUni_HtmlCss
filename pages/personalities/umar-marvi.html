	<p>The story of Marvi and Umar is a famous divine Sindhi folk tale, on which the sufi poet Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai deployed the one of the surs of his Risalo.<br>
	Umar, the King of Umarkot, is searching for a bride but finds none to his liking. Phog demonstrates the unmatchable beauty of Marvi, a village girl from the area of Malir whom he loves but who is engaged and committed to a fellow villager, Khet. Umar then takes a decision to check out Marvi for himself and instantly falls under her spell. After unsuccessfully inquiring for her hand from her father, he decides to abduct her. Confined in the palace of Umar, Marvi stubbornly denies becoming his wife, faithful and loyal to her pledge to Khet. Turning down all the valuable silks and jewelry, she longs for her persons, the Marus. When Marvi was just about to surrender, having lost hope of being saved and rescued, wet-nurse discloses the reality that they are milk siblings, thus ruling out any possibility of wedding between them. Umar then hands Marvi back to her parents, but Khet and the Marus suspect her chastity. Upon hearing the news, Umar goes for the place of Malir to defend the honor of Marvi. Both have to perform a trial to show their innocence by walking through a fire holding a red-hot iron rod. Umar and Marvi come out of the pyre without any wounds and burns. In the end, Umar confesses his mistake and blesses Umar Marvi and Khet as they ultimately get married in the end.</p>
