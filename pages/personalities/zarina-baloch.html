	<h1>Early life and family of Zarina Baloch</h1>
	<p>She was born on the day of December 29, 1934 in the area of Allahdad Chand Village, Hyderabad, Sindh province. Her mother, Gulroz, breathed last in the year of 1940 when Zarina was only 6 years old. She acquired education with Mohammad Juman, who was also a popular Sindhi singer. At early age 15 years, her family decided her marriage with a remote relative. She had 2 kids: Akhter Baloch also famous to be known as Zeena (born in the year of 1952), and Asalm Parvez (born in the year of 1957). Although, Baloch and her husband disagreed on the topic of her higher education and the pair were separated on the year of 1958. <br>Baloch then joined Radio Hyderabad in the year of 1960 and gained her 1st Music Award in the year of 1961.
